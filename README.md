# Algorithm2-basic_python

oh wow so nice to see someone looking at this shit.

so this is just some basic python shit from IULI Algorithm class that i joined.
if you know more than me and able to do python as your casual programming language you might want to leave from here,
cause this is gonna be boring for you, like i was saying this repo only shows the basic of it.

anyway, if you new to python, have a good look at this repo and learn this shit it's actually pretty entertaining.
